ulogd2 (2.0.5-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  WARNING: You may need to update your iptables or ebtables configuration!

  The ipt_ULOG and ebt_ulog modules, and thus the ULOG targets for iptables and
  ebtables, were removed in the 3.17 kernel. NFLOG replaces ULOG and works for
  iptables, ip6tables and ebtables. If you are using the ULOG target in your
  configuration, you will need to replace it with NFLOG for your configuration
  to apply correctly under current kernels.

  You will also need to ensure NFLOG is enabled in the ulogd configuration.
  This is enabled by default.
